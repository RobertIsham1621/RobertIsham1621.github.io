		<h2>An Introduction to Robert </h2>

		
		<p> Robert's Isham ancestors had lived in Northamptonshire and London since at least 1300.</p>
		<p>In 1621, a parish priest christened Robert in Cheshunt, a village 15 miles north of London. Robert's parents, William and Marie Isome, had moved to Cheshunt from London in the spring of 1620.</p>
			<p>The death of his mother Marie in 1634 left Robert motherless at age 13. The following year, Robert voyaged from London to Virigina aboard a ship named the Globe. His shipmate on the voyage was his 20-year-old uncle Edward Cleborne, son of James Cleborne.</p>
				<p>Robert labored as a servant in Virginia for several years. The work in Virginia was difficult. Marriage opportunities were few. With good reason, Robert returned to England. There, he settled in the village of Green's Norton, Northamptonshire.</p>
					<p>Robert married Jane Clubber on 26 January 1643 in Green's Norton. Together, they had at least three children before Robert died at age 40 in April 1662. Six generations of descendants lived and labored in villages near Green's Norton.</p>
						<p>Today, Robert has descendants throughout England, the United States, and Australia.</p>
		<p>We are happy you dropped in! Enjoy learning about Robert, his ancestors, and his descendants.</p>

      	<h1>Y-DNA Evidence Taught Us Robert's Story </h1>
		<p class="dropcap">In 2021, one of Robert's patrlineal descendants took a Y-DNA test that was critical in understanding the story of Robert's life. Before the DNA test, there was uncertainty about who Robert's parents and grandparents were, and we didn't know the story of his
			life before he married Jane Clubber in Green's Norton in 1642.

		<h4>Growing Up in Cheshunt</h4>
		<p><img alt="Church of St. Mary, Cheshunt" class="img-curved-right" src="img/Cheshunt.jpg"> Although researchers had known that a Robert Isome
		was christened in Cheshunt in 1621 as the son of William Isome and Marie Harding, they were reluctant to commit that this Robert was the same as the Robert who
	married Jane Clubber in 1642.  The Y-DNA evidence confirmed that Robert of Green's Norton was the same Robert who was christened in Cheshunt.  
Further, it allowed us to identify William's parents.  </p>

		<h4>Voyage to Virginia</h4>
		<p><img alt="17th Century Engraving of a Boat" class="img-curved-left" src="img/Globe.jpg">Furthermore, the Y-DNA evidence showed that Robert of Cheshunt
		and Green's Norton was also the same Robert who sailed to Virginia on the Globe in 1635, accompanied by his uncle
	Edward Cleburne.</p>

		<h3>Robert and his Isham Ancestors</h3>
		<p><em>Many Ishams and Isoms lived in the Northamptonshire villages of Green's Norton, Wappenham, Greatworth, Blakesly, Chipping Warden, and Marston St. Lawrence.
			These are their Isham ancestors: </em></p>

			<p>Like his father before him, Robert was the escheator for the county of Northamptonshire.
				In his role as a justice of the peace for Northamptonshire, Robert often
			traveled to Westminster Palace in London where he met with King Henry VI, 
		Richard Duke of York, and other important figures in the Wars of the Roses. </p>
			<p> His first wife was Elizabeth de Knuston, by whom he had son William. 
				By his second wife, Margaret, he had three other  sons. </p>

			<p>William Isham of Pytchley, esquire, son and heir of Robert Isham, succeeded his father about 1475.
				William married Elizabeth widow of Thomas Bramspeth.  Together, Wiliam and Elizabeth had at least three
			sons and one daughter. </p>

			<dt>Thomas Isham 1456-1512</dt>
			<dd>
			<p>His wife was Ellen Vere, daughter of Richard Vere of Addington and by Isabel, daughter of John Green of Drayton. 
				 She was probably married in 1485, for by a deed of 11 May 1485 the feoffees 
				 of William Isham's Northamptonshire lands gave them to his son Thomas Isham and Ellen his wife and the heirs of their bodies.  
				They had two sons: 1) Euseby Isham of Pytchley, 2) John Isham, 
				living in 1558 when his nephew Gregory gave him a legacy of five pounds.  </p>

			<dd>
			<p>Born in Pytchley, Northamptonshire, Euseby spent most of his life 
				on a farm in the parish of Ringstead, Northamptonshire. He is said on his son John's monument
				 to have had twenty children, of whom we know the names of five sons and five daughters.

			<p>Like his older brothers Gregory and John, Henry was a succesful London mercer and
				merchant adventurer.  Henry married Joan Bresley in London in 1557.  Henry and
				Joan lived in the parish of St. Olave Old Jewry, where most of their children were christened. In 1587,
				he was appointed to the important role of Controller of the Port of London. </p>

			<dd>
			<p>Born in London in 1567, Apollonya moved to her father's estate on Dancer's Hill in 
				South Mimms, probably around 1577.  Around 1585 she had a relationship 
			outside of marriage with James Cleburne, who was born in South Mimms.  A son William was 
			born of the union. In 1587 she married Robert Lee in South Mimms, and together 
			they had a daughter Mary Lee.  Mary Lee's marriage allegation in 1612 indicates
			that her guardian was Apollonya's sister Susan Isham of London.</p>

			Marie Harding in London in 1619 in the church of St. Peter, Paul's wharf, 1/2 mile
