His will of 3 Sept. 1558 was proved 16 Nov. 1558" by his four brothers, the executors. He had been sometime a merchant in London, and reckons his merchandize in London and beyond sea as part of his personal estate, which he divides in three parts according to the custom of London, and as he left 20l. to the mercers' company for two dinners, he must have been a citizen free of their gild. The manor of Braunston with lands in Braunston, Farthingston, Old and Irchester were devised by him to his wife for life, his heirs succeeding to his lands in Creake and Creaton.
