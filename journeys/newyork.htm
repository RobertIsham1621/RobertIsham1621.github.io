		<h1>To New York by Sea </h1>
		<p><img alt="The William Tapscott" class="img-curved-left" src="../img/tapscott.png">
			From 11 May 1860 to 16 June 1860, <a href="../descendants/aqwg07.htm#128">Owen and Elizabeth Howard Isom  </a> and their children traveled by boat from Liverpool to New York. The ship was named The William Tapscott.
			  George Isom, the son of Owen and Elizabeth, left a memoir with the story of the voyage:
			  <blockquote>
					"I shall never forget my feelings when standing upon the docks at Liverpool and looking forth upon the mighty waters. The chilly sea breeze seemed to penetrate my bones and cause a shrinking feeling of fear to come over me, but this was soon dispelled by the novelty of the scene as I could not recollect having ever previously been more than 8 or 10 miles from home and had never seen a ship or stream or body of water larger than a brook before. Here I was in sight of hundreds of vessels, both sail and steam, with tow and other smaller craft in real numbers while at the docks and through the town the bustle and thrift caused by the commerce of the sea was everywhere visible.
				</blockquote>
				<blockquote>
					After looking around awhile a towboat drew up alongside the wharf upon which we thronged with our luggage to be conveyed to the vessel which stood out from shore some distance at anchor. 
				</blockquote>
				<blockquote>
					Soon reached the side of the ship, a most noble looking vessel and previous to embarking, while yet upon the towboat it appeared to be about as high as a three story house, but when the passengers, one thousand, in number, were, .all aboard it settled down in the water considerably. The ships name was William Tapscott. Captain Dell, this gentleman proved very kind and gentlemanly in bearing towards our people. As soon as we were all aboard the sailors weighed anchor and the tow boat, though comparatively small, by means of a stout cable attached to its stern and to the bow of our Vessel caused us to glide easily and rapidly through the water. This was the eighth of May 1860. My brother Samuel's birthday, he was 11 years of age. All went smoothly until evening when as we had become localized in our new quarters we turned to oar bunks and we were soon sleeping soundly. Towards morning upon awaking we found that our vessel had ceased to glide smoothly, our little champion, the tow boat had left us to our fate and we rolled and pitched considerably, disturbing the equilibrium of the greater number of the passengers stomachs. What a deplorable set of beings we appeared to be, nearly all sick and of course few to give sympathy, Father, fortunately, was not troubled by the rolling of the vessel so he had to practice the art of cookery for himself and the rest of us when we could eat, although we all soon recovered with the exception of Samuel, who did not fully recover for two or three weeks.
				</blockquote>	
				<blockquote>
					We were five weeks upon the sea this was a long time to be confined within the narrow limits of a sailing vessel, although a life on the ocean wave was new and novel to us and we were diverted by watching the sailors and hearing them sing, haul, haul, haul away, haul away jo, and then upon reaching the word jo, all pulling together, with many other sailor rhymes, and also in looking abroad over the vast expanse presented to our view and occasionally sighting some other vessel, Here the theory of the earths being round was fully demonstrated to our satisfaction, for upon sighting a vessel in the distance the tops of the masts only could be seen but as they gradually drew nearer, the lower part of the vessel was presented to our view. We also occasionally saw shoals of porpoises, which came gamboling upon the surface of the deep, and when on account of unfavorable winds we were compelled to tack to the north to make headway. We saw jets of water occasionally rising several feet above the otherwise smooth surface of the ocean, we watched anxiously for a glimpse of the whale, but mister whale failed to show anything but his locality at breathing time.
				</blockquote>	
				<blockquote>	
					We as Latter-Day-Saints did not forget our God amidst the excitement and curiosities of an ocean voyage, but our hearts and voices were ever turned to him in prayer and praise and we were blessed and prospered upon the seas and escaped all dangers and although many in number. I do not remember more than two or three being rolled in canvas and slid off plank into the watery grave. Notwithstanding the novelty of a sea voyage to one traveling over its bosom for the first time we were ever joyful when we beheld the low misty outlines of Long Island."
