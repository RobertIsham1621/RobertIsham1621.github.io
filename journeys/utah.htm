		<h1>To Utah by Land </h1>
		<p><img alt="The William Tapscott" class="img-curved-left" src="../img/platte.jpeg">
			In the spring of 1862, <a href="../descendants/aqwg07.htm#128">Owen and Elizabeth Howard Isom  </a> and their children
			 traveled by rail from New York to Florence Nebraska.  From Florence, they traveled
			 by wagon to Utah.
			  George Isom, the son of Owen and Elizabeth, left a memoir with the story of the journey:
				<blockquote>
			  "At length all preparations [in Florence] being completed we moved camp traveling to the Elk Horn River from this time with an 
occasional day of rest to repair wagons, shoe oxen and wash. We continued our journey through the fertile plains of 
Nebraska, our oxen enjoying its luxuriant pastures and the effects of daily feats in pedestrianism, such as we workshop
hands had to perform (as we were loaded so heavily we were compelled to walk with the exception of mother and the baby 
Franklin Howard, they had the privilege of riding in no great amount of comfort upon the load) gave an appetite that made 
us ever ready for our meals. My mother's solicitude in my behalf on account of my not eating but little, changed to a desire 
for more time and conveyance to supply us.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
The crossing of Soup Fork Ferry was to us boys quite an interesting experience, as it occupied considerable time in 
crossing and having no teams to drive we rolled about in the stream a good share of the day. The stream being shallow in 
places we would ride over the deeper channels and then jump out and push as the boat grazed the sands.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
As we approached the Rocky Mountains the face of the country changed rapidly in appearance. The pleasant 
prairies no longer cheered the eye or refreshed the oxen with their luxuriant herbage, sage plains, stretches of sand; barren 
wastes and rocky steeps were now prominent characteristics of the country. Our oxen began to loose strength and flesh and 
upon reaching Green River my father was compelled to sell one yoke of oxen, on account of their poverty, and buy one that 
had not suffered from the fatigues of a march across the plains. Many others were compelled to likewise. Cold nights and 
mornings now began to warn us of the near approach of winter, a slight covering of snow at the south pass caused us to feel 
a desire to reach our destination and find a settled abode to shelter from the coming storms. At the Weber River we were 
met by my brother William, we were much pleased to behold him again and at a point so near the termination of our journey 
as to make us feel at home. In Parleys Canyon we lost an ox for such a length of time that we almost gave him up and the 
train moved on but upon ascending a very high hill overlooking the canyon we could discern him in a dense growth of 
willows. We descended in haste, driving him before us, followed the team, but did not again overtake it until we arrived at 
the camp in Salt Lake City."
