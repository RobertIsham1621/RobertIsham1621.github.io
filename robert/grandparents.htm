		<h1>Robert's Grandparents </h1>

		<h3> The Question</h3>
	<p class="dropcap"> As a result of the 2021 DNA test, it was clear that Robert Isham of Green's Norton was a shipmate with Edward Cleborne in 1635. 
		 Robert had grown up near Edward.  And the two men had matching Y-DNA.  So how were they related?</p>

		<p>To answer the question, it was clear that we needed to learn more about Robert's father William and Edward's father James.</p>

		<h3> More About William Isome/Ishame</h3>
		<p class="dropcap"> The records showed that  William Isome and Marie his wife had christened a daughter in Cheshunt on 19 March 1620,
			a year before Robert was christened in 1621.  A search of records on Ancestry showed that William Ishame and Marie Harding
		had married just five months before the christening, on 13 October 1619 in London.  They had married in the parish
	of St. Peter, Paul's wharf. </p>

		<p>  Most Ishams living in London in the late 1500's and early 1600's were descendants of 
			Henry Isham (1528-1595), a succesful London merchant and controller of the port of London. 
			Henry and most of his children lived in the parish of St. Olave, Old Jewry.  St. Olave was less than half a mile
			from St. Peter, Paul's wharf.  No christening record could be found, but Could William Ishame be related to Henry somehow?
		</p>

		<h3> More About James Cleborne</h3>
		<p class="dropcap">  James Cleborne married Agnes Jurye in the parish of Waltham Abbey on 19 July 1590.  Together, they had seven children
			born between 1593 and 1614.  James' will showed that he worked as bargeman on the River Lea, and was a man of modest means.
		</p>
	
		
		<h3>A Focus on South Mimms</h3>
		<p class="dropcap">  Church records show that James Cleborne (spelled Clybburne)
			  was christened on 10 May 1564 in South Mimms, Hertfordshire.  The focus to learn more about James and his relationship
			  to the Ishams thus soon focused on South Mimms.  Did the Ishams have any connections to South Mimms?
		</p>
		<p >  Indeed, Henry Isham, merchant of London, had purchased the Dancer's Hill estate in South Mimms in 1577, when James Cleburne
			would have been 13 years old.  Furthermore, Henry's daughter Apollonya, christened in the parish of St. Olave in London on 
			12 July 1567, married Robert Lee in South Mimms on 20 June 1587.  Apollonya may have moved to her father's estate as early in 1577,
			and was certainly living in South Mimms ten years later.
	  </p>
	  <h3> The Conclusion</h3>
	  <p >  James Cleburne was three years older than Apollonya and they lived in South Mimms at the same time. 
		 A descendant of William's son Robert is a Y-DNA match for descendants of James' son Edward.  William lived near
		the Henry Isham clan in London.  The  conclusion that follows from the evidence is that James and Apollonya had a extra-marital relationship, and
		that William was born of that union.
	 </p>

	 <h3> Addtional Evidence</h3>
	 <p class="dropcap"> The last child of William Isome and Marie Harding, Rachell Isome, was christened 22 November 1629 in Cheshunt. 
		The parish records do not record another birth to Marie before her burial, as wife of William Isome, on 18 January 1634.
		 William and Marie lived together as a couple between 1629 and 1634 and did not have another child suggests; 
		 1. Marie was at the end of her child-bearing years, 2. Marie had fallen ill and her health did not support 
		 bearing any more children (miscarriages were not recorded, but stillbirths were), or 3. some combination thereof.
		  If Mary was at the end of her child-birthing years, 
		that would suggest that she was around 40 years old in 1629. That would place her birth about 1589.  It was typical
		for a husband to be about three years older than his wife.  If this were the case, then William would have been born about 1586,
		when Apollonya Isham  would have been 19 and  James Cleborne 21 years old, both living in South Mimms.
	</p>

	 <p >  There is evidence that William Isome may have been raised primarily by Apollonya's older sister, 
		Susan Isham Sturdevant. Susan, born about 1559, was married first to a successful Mercer Edmund Borlase. 
		After Edmund's death in 1584, Susan married Francis Sturdevant, a London grocer. Francis also died in 1587, 
		leaving 27-year-old Susan a wealthy widow in London. William was probably born just the year before, in 1586, 
		so Susan would have been a good position to adopt the infant William and help her sister Apollonya to start a new life. 
		The hypothesis that Susan was the guardian of William is bolstered by the fact that Susan was the guardian of Apollonya's second child, Mary Lee. The 1612 marriage allegation for Mary Lee, described Mary as a "maiden of London aforesaid aged 18 yeres or there abowtes whose parentes are both deceased and she solie at the goverm[en]t and disposinge of Mris Suzan Sturtivant widowe her aunt w[i]th whome she nowe dwelleth, and whose consent is obteyned hereunto." If Susan was the guardian of Mary,
		 it is reasonable to believe that she had also been the guardian of Mary's older half-brother William.
	</p>

	<h3> Conclusion</h3>
	<p class="dropcap"> Robert Isome was the son of William Isome/Ishame and Marie Harding.  William was the son of James Cleborne
		and Apollonya Isham.  William was probably raised in London but his aunt Susan Isham.  After marrying in London, he moved
		to Cheshunt and lived near his father.  Robert Isome and Edward Cleborne grew up near each other, and were shipmates on the Globe in 1635.
