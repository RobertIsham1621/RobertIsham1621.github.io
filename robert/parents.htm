		<h1>Robert's Parents </h1>

		<h3> The Question</h3>
	<p class="dropcap"> Since about 1950, reasearchers had known Robert as the progenitor of Ishams and Isoms in the Northamptonshire
		villages of Green's Norton, Wappenham, Greatworth, Blakesly, Chipping Warden, and Marston St. Lawrence.  But they weren't sure
		about Robert's parents.  The best candidates seemed to be William Isham of Maidford (1582-1640)
		and Katherine Cammfiled, who married on 8 June 1621 in Tiffield, Northamptonshire.  Tiffield was just
		five miles away from Green's Norton where Robert married 22 years later in  1643.  Unfortunately,
		the church records for Maidford in that era had been lost, so it was hard to check the theory.  </p>
		
		<p> Researchers
		had concluded that William Isham of Maidford  was a descendant of Robert Isham of Pytchley (1402-1475).  In the absence
		of a christening record, could a Y-DNA test demonstrate that Robert 1621-1662 descended from Robert 1402-1475? 
		</p>
		<h3> Some Key Information</h3>
		<p class="dropcap"> In 2021, an eleventh-generation descendant of Robert 1621-1662 contacted the Anglo-American Isham Ancestry Association (AAIAA).
			 The AAIAA was founded to foster genealogical collaboration among descendants of Robert Isham of Pytchley (1402-1475).
			The AAIAA provided two key pieces of information that were essential to finding the true parents of Robert 1621-1662.  First,
			two patrilineal descendants of Robert Isham of Pytchley (1402-1475) had just taken a Y-DNA test.  Second, the <a href="http://www.aaiaa.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/AAIAA-L1.pdf">  
				AAIAA website</a> noted that a 14-year-old Robert Isham had sailed to Virginia in 1635.
		 </p>
		 <p>
			Knowing that Y-DNA results existed for the Ishams of Pytchley was important because it meant that it would
			be possible to know if descendants of Robert 1621-1662 also had direct patrilineal descent from Robert Isham of Pytchley (1402-1475).
			The descendant of Robert 1621-1662 took a DNA test and anxiously awaited the result.
		</p>

		<p> The finding that a 14-year-old Robert traveled to Virginia was intriguing because Robert of Green's Norton 
			would have been about 14 in 1635.
		</p>
		<h3> A Surprising DNA Result</h3>
		<p class="dropcap">  When the Y-DNA test came back, the surprising result was that the descendant of Robert 1621-1662 
			was not a match for the Ishams of Pytchley.  Instead, he matched 23 men with surnames Claborn, Claiborne, Clayborn, Claybourn, Cleborne, Cliborn, 
			Cliburn, Clyborne, Clyburn, and Clyburne.  A significant percentage of these men were known to descend from 
			Edward Cleborne, who traveled to Virginia in 1635.
		</p>

		<h3> Traveling Companions</h3>
		<p class="dropcap">  A quick check showed that 14-year-old Robert Isham and 20-year-old Edward Cleborne were actually shipmates aboard
			a vessel called The Globe, bound from London to Virginia in 1635!  The two young men must have been related somehow!
		</p>

		<h3> Isham and Cleborne</h3>
		<p class="dropcap">   To solve the mystery of Robert and Edward, it was apparent that we needed to find places where Ishams and Clebornes lived 
			in close proximity.
		</p>
		<p> The Cleborne family hailed from Westmoreland, far north of London and Northamptonshire.  There were no records of 
			Ishams living in Westmoreland. </p>

		<p>	  There was only one Cleborne known to have lived in Northamptonshire in the mid-1600's: 
			a clergyman of Stanwick named Richard Cleborne.  His will portrayed a strait-laced personality and it seemed unlikely
			that he would have fathered a child outside of marriage.
		</p>

		<p> The only other place to check was in the London area.  Many Ishams of Northamptonshire spent at least 
			part of their working years in London.  And a quick check showed that there were Cleborne's in the London area in the 1600s.
		</p>

		<h3>The Breakthrough</h3>
		<p class="dropcap">  With a focus on the London area, there were soon two breakthroughs!  The record of a Robert Isome christened in Cheshunt in 1621 
			as the son of William and Marie Isome.
		 And the discovery of a will naming as executor an Edward Cleborne who was a minor when the will went to probate in Waltham Cross in 1625.  
		 Cheshunt was less than a mile from Watltham Cross.  Surely, Robert of Cheshunt and Edward of Waltham Cross were the Robert and Edward
		 who sailed together on the Globe in 1635.  And, given the Y-DNA result, our Robert of Green's Norton must be the Robert
		 who was christened as the son of William and Marie in Cheshunt in 1621!
		</p>

		<h3>Open Questions</h3>
		<p class="dropcap">  Questions remained, though.  How exactly were Robert and Edward related?  And who were Robert's grandparents?
